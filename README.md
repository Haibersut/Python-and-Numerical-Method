# Python-and-Numerical-Method
This repository contains a series of assignments for a course on Python and Numerical Methods. The assignments cover topics such as numerical differentiation and integration, root finding, and linear algebra.

## Environment

This code was developed using Python 3.10 and the miniconda environment. You can set up this environment by following these steps:

1. Download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for your operating system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and create a new conda environment: `conda create --name python-numerical-method python=3.10`
3. Activate the environment: `conda activate python-numerical-method`
4. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Getting started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Haibersut/Python-and-Numerical-Method.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory and activate the conda environment:

```bash
cd Python-and-Numerical-Method-Assignments
conda activate python-numerical-method
```

You can then run the assignments using Python:

```bash
python assignment1.py

python assignment2.py
```

And so on.
